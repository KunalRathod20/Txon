          <p>I am a multidisciplinary designer with a curious mind, I enjoy to meet new people and understand how they
            are solving problems, this is one of the reasons why I invest my time on meetups from product management to
            everything related to design (research, design thinking, design system, etc.) and talking to people in
            general, as always can be an opportunity to learn something new. I see it as a chance to improve myself as a
            professional and put things in practice when I’m creating my solutions.</p>

          <p>Creativity is clearly key when it comes to working as a graphic
            designer on any project. But there’s more to creativity than just having great ideas once in a while. When
            working as a graphic designer is your main career and you work on multiple projects with different clients,
            you need to have a structured process that will help you focus your creative thinking. As an employer, you
            need to look for graphic designers who have structured their creative thinking and have a process that
            enables them to come up with ideas continuously, not just through single genius strikes.</p>

          <div class="topic">Web Devlopment</div>
          <p>Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work that happens behind the scenes
            to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience. Web developers, or
            ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding languages. The languages they use depends on the types of tasks
            they are preforming and the platforms on which they are working.</p>

          <div class="topic">Graphic Design</div>
          <p>Graphic design is the craft of planning and creating visual content to communicate ideas and messages.
            Graphic design is everywhere you look in the digital age from billboards to cereal boxes to mobile apps.
            Through incorporating different elements and principles, these designs can influence our perception and
            emotions. Graphic design is also known as communication design, and Graphic Designers are essentially visual
            communicators. They bring visual concepts to life, most commonly through graphic design software, and inform
            or engage consumers through text, graphics and images.</p>

          <div class="topic">Digital Marketing</div>
          <p>Any marketing that uses electronic devices and can be used by marketing specialists to convey promotional
            messaging and measure its impact through your customer journey. In practice, digital marketing typically
            refers to marketing campaigns that appear on a computer, phone, tablet, or other device. It can take many
            forms, including online video, display ads, search engine marketing, paid social ads and social media posts.
            Digital marketing is often compared to “traditional marketing” such as magazine ads, billboards, and direct
            mail.?</p>

          <div class="topic">Icon Design</div>
          <p>Icons are extremely important in graphic design because us humans are primed to read and extract
            information from them. They express actions, ideas, or feelings. They communicate with minimal effort, in a
            universally (or widely accepted) recognizable way. Icons are direct, straightforward, and to the point. They
            are simple but accurate. They can be cute, clever, or slick. Effective icons show only the most minimal
            characteristics of an object or idea, and yet they are accurate and undisputable. They are not open for
            interpretation or ambuiguity.</p>

          <div class="topic">Vector Art</div>
          <p>A vector graphic is defined by math and considered the exact opposite of raster images. In other words,
            raster images store data as a map of pixels and vectors are a service of mathematically defined lines and
            shape. If you were to zoom in on a vector, that wouldn't affect its clarity. No matter how far you zoom in
            or out, you'll always see crisp edges that's where these graphics differ from raster images. You'd see
            pixels if you zoom in on a raster image, whereas a vector is infinitely scalable. If you need something like
            a logo, an icon, or a flat illustration, vector graphics are ideal.</p>

          <div class="topic">Apps Devlopment</div>
          <p>Any application developed to be supported by the Android Operating system using the android software
            development kit (sdk) on android studio is the process of android development. The open-source operating
            system designed by Google especially for mobiles is Android. Android OS has been developed using Linux
            Kernel. Because of the ability of easily modifiable (as its open source), most of the android developers
            have used different GUIs even when all of them use the same basic operating system. The open source code
            used for the development of android applications is Android Open Source Project (AOSP).</p>
